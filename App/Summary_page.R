                        crimes are more common in different states, however 
                        taking the overall tally of the states, California is 
                        doing the worst job at concealing the rate of motivated
                        crimes happening there. But that is hardly a surprise
                        considering that California is the state with the most
                        population among the U.S., the surprising portion of

                        Despite having less population than both Texas and
                        Florida, New York has a significantly higher hate crime

                        agency type in the states where hate crimes are most
                        prevalent. Stating the state where the hate crime mostly
                        occurs is helpful to go beyond that and have the type of
                        area in the state could be even more useful for the
                        average person and we did just that. According to the
                        data visualization, non-metropolitan counties is the
                        area where most hate crimes occur representing a
                        whopping 63.8% among the places hate crime could occur
                        in a state. While this number is truly shocking it is
                        feasible to imagine why this happens since
                        non-metropolitan counties are infamous for lacking proper
                        police coverage around the area. The real shocking
                        takeaway that the visualization conveys is that
